🎓 I am Blake Smith, a student at the University of Northern Iowa pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Focusing in cybersecurity, although working to improve my skills in full-stack engineering.

🏃 Outside of the classroom and the world of technology, I love to stay active and push myself to develop new skills including rock climbing, running, small amounts of piano, and eventually become a golfer that doesn't need more than one redo off the tee.
